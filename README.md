## 🧵 **September 1–3, 2025 — Methods & Strings**  
Learned to write **modular and reusable code** using methods.  

**Covered:**  
- ✍️ Method definition, parameters, and return types  
- 💡 Modular programming concepts  

Then explored **Strings** in depth:  
- 💬 Creation, manipulation, and immutability  
- 🔄 `StringBuffer` & `StringBuilder` for faster operations  
- ⚖️ Compared performance and use-cases  

🧠 This week made me “think in Java” — structured and efficient!

Entered the world of **OOP** — the heart of Java development.  

**Learned:**  
- 🧩 4 Pillars: *Encapsulation*, *Inheritance*, *Polymorphism*, *Abstraction*  
- 🏗️ Constructors (default, parameterized, copy)  
- 🧠 Instance vs static variables  
- 🔐 Access modifiers and their scope  

🧱 Built small projects demonstrating inheritance and encapsulation.

---

## 🧬 **September 15–17, 2025 — Advanced OOP Concepts**  
A deep dive into advanced object-oriented programming!  

**Topics Explored:**  
- 🧱 Interfaces and Abstract Classes  
- 🔁 Method Overloading & Overriding  
- 🧭 Upcasting and Downcasting  
- 🧩 Polymorphism in compile-time and runtime  

⚡ Combined abstraction and interfaces in mini projects to strengthen understanding.

---

## ⚙️ **September 22–24, 2025 — Applying OOP to Real Scenarios**  
Applied theoretical knowledge to **real-world Java problems**.  

**Focus Areas:**  
- 🧩 Building modular, reusable code  
- 🧠 Applying OOP principles (encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism)  
- 💼 Writing structured, maintainable code for real use cases  

🧑‍💻 Gained practical experience solving scenario-based problems.

---

## 🪄 **October 13–15, 2025 — Interfaces & Lambda Expressions**  
Explored **Interfaces** and **Functional Programming** concepts.  

**Learned:**  
- 🧩 Functional, Marker, Default, and Static Interfaces  
- 🪶 Lambda Expressions for cleaner, concise code  

✨ Implemented functional interfaces with lambdas — making Java code modern and elegant.

---

## 🧰 **October 27–29, 2025 — Packages, Exceptions & Wrapper Classes**  
Focused on organizing, securing, and optimizing code.  

**Covered:**  
- 📦 Creating and importing packages  
- ⚠️ Exception handling: `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, `throws`  
- 🧾 Checked vs unchecked exceptions  
- 🧊 Wrapper Classes (Autoboxing & Unboxing)  

✅ Built programs combining packages, exception handling, and wrappers for robustness.

---

## 🗃️ **November 3–5, 2025 — Generics, Collections & JDBC**  
Final phase: connecting Java to the real world through data and reusability.  

**Learned:**  
- 🧩 Generics for type-safe, reusable code  
- 📚 Collections Framework: `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, and `Map`
